# Really Slick Screensavers
It is a package of some neat screensavers that were done by **Terence M. Welsh** ([http://www.reallyslick.com](http://www.reallyslick.com)).

The original code was imported to GitHub and project files were updated to support Visual Studio 2015 version.

The supporting libraries ([rslibs](https://github.com/reallyslickscreensavers/rslibs)) are licensed under the Gnu LGPL version 2.1.
